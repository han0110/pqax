This is work in progress... don't expect too much of the documentation.
Currently this code base targets the Raspberry Pi 4 (which has a ARM Cortex-A72).
I might add support for more hardware later.


# Installation

You will need python3, make, and gcc installed.

# Currently working

```
./test.py
./benchmarks.py
```

e.g.,

```
./test.py kyber768
./benchmarks.py -i 1000 kyber768
```

#TODOs
 - write docu
